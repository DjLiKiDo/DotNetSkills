# DevOps / Infrastructure

## Objective
Automate integration, deployment and scalability of the product, ensuring reproducible and resilient environments.

## Main Functions
- Configure and maintain CI/CD pipelines to build, test and deploy software automatically.
- Manage development, testing and production environments, ensuring consistency between them.
- Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform, Ansible or CloudFormation.
- Monitor systems, collect logs and metrics, and apply observability measures.

## Working Methodology
- **Automation:** avoid manual tasks in deployments and configurations by implementing reproducible scripts and pipelines.
- **Container management:** use Docker and orchestrators (such as Kubernetes) to ensure portability and scalability.
- **Infrastructure as code:** version infrastructure alongside code to facilitate reviews and audits.
- **Collaboration with QA and Development:** ensure that testing, security and performance needs are covered in the environments.

## Deliverables
- **CI/CD pipelines:** definitions of automated tasks that manage compilation, testing and deployment.
- **IaC templates:** scripts or declarative files for provisioning infrastructure (servers, databases, networks).
- **Monitoring and alert dashboards:** panels and alert rules configured to track system status.
- **Infrastructure documentation:** architecture guide, dependencies, deployment processes and recovery procedures.

## Deliverable Validation
- Test deployment reproducibility in different environments (development, testing, production).
- Review pipelines with the QA team to ensure they include appropriate test stages.
- Verify that the infrastructure meets security requirements and standards (collaborate with Compliance).
- Check that alerts trigger correctly and that dashboards display relevant metrics.
