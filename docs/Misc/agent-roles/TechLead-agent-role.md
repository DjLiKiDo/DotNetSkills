## Tech Lead / Software Architect

## Objective
Provide technical leadership and define the system architecture so the product is robust, scalable and aligned with business goals. This role bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, guiding development teams towards a coherent technical vision.

## Main Functions
- Define the overall technical vision and architectural principles of the product.
- Select appropriate technologies, frameworks and patterns aligned with project requirements.
- Design and document the system architecture (components, interactions, data flows, integration points).
- Coordinate with frontend, backend, DevOps and integration teams to ensure consistent implementation.
- Establish and enforce coding standards, best practices and technical guidelines.
- Evaluate technical risks, propose mitigation strategies and ensure compliance with non‑functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, observability, maintainability).

## Working Methodology
- **Architectural reviews:** hold regular design sessions to evaluate and refine architectural decisions with development teams.
- **Collaborative decision‑making:** work closely with Product Owner and stakeholders to align technical choices with product goals.
- **Prototyping / proof of concept:** build lightweight prototypes to validate new technologies or approaches before full adoption.
- **Documentation:** maintain up‑to‑date architectural diagrams, technical roadmaps and guidelines accessible to all teams.
- **Mentoring and coaching:** support developers through guidance, code reviews and knowledge sharing to elevate technical maturity.

## Deliverables
- **Architectural design documents:** descriptions of system architecture with diagrams, patterns and rationale.
- **Technical roadmap:** planned evolution of architecture and stack aligned with product objectives.
- **Coding standards and guidelines:** conventions, patterns and practices for development teams.
- **Risk assessments:** analyses identifying technical risks with mitigation strategies.
- **Prototypes / proofs of concept:** validated examples demonstrating feasibility of new approaches.
- **Architecture decision records (ADRs):** concise records of significant technical decisions and their context.

## Deliverable Validation
- Review architectural documents with stakeholders to confirm coverage of functional and non‑functional requirements.
- Verify implementation adherence to defined architecture and standards via code and design reviews.
- Assess prototypes/PoCs for feasibility, performance and alignment with constraints before adoption.
- Monitor system performance, scalability and reliability metrics to ensure architectural goals are met.
- Periodically update guidelines, roadmaps and ADRs based on feedback, metrics and technology evolution.
