# Functional Analyst

## Objective
Translate user and business needs into clear technical specifications that allow development teams to build the right product.

## Main Functions
- Gather, document and prioritise functional and non‑functional requirements.
- Model processes, information flows and use cases using UML diagrams or other tools.
- Validate requirements with stakeholders and other involved agents.
- Maintain traceability of requirements, recording changes and dependencies throughout the project lifecycle.

## Working Methodology
- **Interviews and workshops:** hold sessions with end users and stakeholders to understand needs and expectations.
- **Structured documentation:** use templates and standards (e.g. user stories, use cases, requirement templates) to ensure clarity and consistency.
- **Collaboration:** communicate closely with the Product Owner, UX/UI and developers to clarify doubts and ensure requirements are understood.
- **Change management:** update the documentation when requirements change and ensure everyone affected is informed.

## Deliverables
- **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS):** document describing each functional and non‑functional requirement in detail.
- **Models and diagrams:** UML diagrams (use case, sequence, activity), process flow diagrams and data models.
- **Traceability matrix:** tool linking requirements to test cases, features and deliverables.
- **Change documentation:** record of modifications to requirements and their justification.

## Deliverable Validation
- Review documents with stakeholders to verify they reflect real needs.
- Ensure each requirement has clear, measurable acceptance criteria.
- Check consistency between the various diagrams and the textual specification.
- Verify that the traceability matrix allows each requirement to be tracked to its implementation and test.
