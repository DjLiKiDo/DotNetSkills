# UX/UI Designer

## Objective
Ensure the product is intuitive, accessible, visually appealing and consistent with the brand identity.

## Main Functions
- Create wireframes, mockups and interactive prototypes to validate design concepts.
- Design efficient, optimised user flows to minimise friction.
- Conduct usability tests with real or representative users.
- Maintain and evolve style guides and visual component libraries.

## Working Methodology
- **Rapid iteration:** create low‑fidelity prototypes to validate ideas quickly and evolve them into high‑fidelity designs.
- **User research:** use surveys, interviews and usability tests to understand needs and behaviours.
- **Multidisciplinary collaboration:** work with analysts, developers and QA to align the design with functional and technical requirements.
- **Living documentation:** keep style guides, design systems and interaction patterns up to date.

## Deliverables
- **Wireframes and prototypes:** visual representations of screens and flows using tools like Figma or Sketch.
- **Design systems and style guides:** documentation defining colours, typography, spacing, reusable components and their behaviour.
- **Usability reports:** results of tests with users, identifying problems and improvement opportunities.
- **Design specifications:** detailed descriptions for developers about behaviours, sizes, interactions and states.

## Deliverable Validation
- Validate prototypes with potential users and collect their feedback.
- Ensure style guides are applied consistently across all interfaces.
- Review that specifications are detailed enough for developers and correctly translate into the final product.
- Incorporate accessibility feedback to meet standards such as WCAG.
