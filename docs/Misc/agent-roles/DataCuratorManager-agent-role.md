# Data Curator / Manager

## Objective
Ensure the quality, organisation and availability of data throughout its lifecycle, complying with privacy regulations and standards.

## Main Functions
- Perform cleaning, normalisation and enrichment of data to improve its usefulness and consistency.
- Anonymise or pseudonymise sensitive data to comply with regulations such as GDPR.
- Label and document datasets to facilitate their use by AI agents and analysts.
- Manage data pipelines, versions and metadata to ensure traceability and reproducibility.

## Working Methodology
- **Data quality:** establish quality rules and metrics (completeness, consistency, uniqueness) and monitor compliance.
- **Privacy and compliance:** apply anonymisation techniques and data governance to meet regulations and internal policies.
- **Management tools:** use data catalogues and versioning systems to organise and document datasets.
- **Collaboration:** work with the Model Learning Agent, Backend and Legal teams to ensure data meets functional and legal requirements.

## Deliverables
- **Data catalogue:** documented inventory of available datasets with descriptions, schemas and metadata.
- **Cleaned and enriched datasets:** processed versions of data ready to be consumed by models or applications.
- **Quality reports:** metrics and reports on the state of the data and cleaning actions performed.
- **Anonymisation log:** documentation of the anonymisation process, methodologies applied and justification.

## Deliverable Validation
- Check that datasets meet the defined quality metrics and that transformations do not introduce errors.
- Verify with the Legal and Compliance team that anonymisation techniques are adequate and sufficient.
- Ensure that the data catalogue remains updated and accessible to the agents that require it.
- Evaluate that quality reports identify trends and areas for improvement in the data.
