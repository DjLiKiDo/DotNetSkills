# Frontend Developer

## Objective
Build the user interface and client‑side interaction, ensuring a smooth, accessible experience consistent with the UX/UI design.

## Main Functions
- Implement components, views and pages of the application following design specifications.
- Integrate the interface with the backend via API calls and manage the application state.
- Ensure accessibility, performance and cross‑browser/device compatibility.
- Apply frontend best practices (modularity, reactivity, component testing, etc.).

## Working Methodology
- **Component‑based development:** reuse and compose components to build scalable interfaces.
- **Collaboration with UX/UI:** review prototypes and style guides to ensure design fidelity.
- **Interface testing:** create unit and integration tests (e.g. Jest, Cypress) to ensure quality.
- **Performance optimisation:** apply techniques such as lazy loading, memoisation, bundle size reduction and monitoring Web Vitals.

## Deliverables
- **Interface code:** components, pages and styles implemented in the chosen framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- **Automated tests:** unit and integration test suites for components and user flows.
- **Component documentation:** description of props, events, states and usage examples.
- **Accessibility guidelines:** information on how to meet accessibility standards and compatibility testing.

## Deliverable Validation
- Review the interface with the UX/UI Designer to ensure visual and interaction consistency.
- Run automated and usability tests to detect errors and improve user experience.
- Check accessibility with tools such as Lighthouse or Axe.
- Conduct cross‑browser/device testing to ensure consistent behaviour.
