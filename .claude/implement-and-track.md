Track task progress and maintain context in @CurrentTask.md throughout the implementation process, including:

1. Document current implementation status
2. Record key decisions and reasoning
3. List remaining steps
4. Note any blockers or dependencies
5. Track validation criteria

Review and ensure code implementation adheres to established project standards:

- Architecture patterns
- Design principles
- Coding conventions
- Error handling approaches
- Testing strategies
- Documentation requirements

If deviations are found:
1. Document the inconsistency
2. Propose refactoring approach
3. Update affected components
4. Validate changes against project standards
5. Update technical documentation

Reference project architecture documentation and style guides when evaluating consistency.

Mark task complete only after:
- All implementation steps are done
- Code review confirms pattern compliance
- Tests pass
- Documentation is updated
- Changes are validated against requirements
