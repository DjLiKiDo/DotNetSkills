# Current Task: Basic Security Setup - Phase 1 Critical Functionality

**Task Selected:** Configure JWT with temporary keys, remove hardcoded credentials, basic Key Vault integration  
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Risk: HIGH - Security vulnerabilities in production)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Business Impact:** Authentication system non-functional, production security breach potential

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 1, this was the final critical security task. Successfully established basic security configuration, removed hardcoded credentials, and prepared the application for secure production deployment.

## Task Details
- **Issue:** JWT disabled, hardcoded production credentials, missing Key Vault integration
- **Expected Behavior:** JWT authentication enabled, secure credential management, production-ready security
- **Dependencies:** Azure Key Vault integration, JWT configuration, secure credential storage

## Progress
- âœ… COMPLETED Task planning and context documentation
- âœ… COMPLETED Configured JWT for development with secure temporary keys
- âœ… COMPLETED Removed hardcoded production credentials from appsettings.Production.json
- âœ… COMPLETED Verified Azure Key Vault integration is properly implemented
- âœ… COMPLETED Created comprehensive security deployment documentation
- âœ… COMPLETED All 8 JWT validation tests pass
- âœ… COMPLETED Application startup test with JWT authentication enabled
- âœ… COMPLETED Full test suite runs successfully (171 total tests passing)

## Implementation Details
- **JWT Configuration**: 
  - Enabled JWT authentication in development (appsettings.json)
  - Added secure 256-bit signing key for development
  - Configured proper issuer and audience settings
- **Production Security**:
  - Removed hardcoded database connection string
  - Added security documentation note in production config
  - Empty JWT signing key requires environment variable/Key Vault
- **Key Vault Integration**: 
  - Existing Azure Key Vault integration verified working
  - PrefixKeyVaultSecretManager properly configured
  - Secret naming convention: DotNetSkills-Section--Key
- **Security Documentation**: Created SECURITY-DEPLOYMENT.md with:
  - Environment variable configuration instructions
  - Azure Key Vault setup guide
  - JWT signing key generation methods
  - Security best practices and troubleshooting
- **Validation**: All JWT options validation tests pass (8 tests)
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)  
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (171 total tests - 72 Domain + 26 Application + 25 Infrastructure + 48 API)

## Phase 1 Critical Functionality: COMPLETED! ðŸŽ‰
Basic Security Setup task successfully completed Phase 1.

## Notes
This task establishes essential security foundations for production deployment. JWT authentication is now enabled, hardcoded credentials have been eliminated, and Azure Key Vault integration is ready for production use. The application is now secure enough for initial production deployment while maintaining security best practices.
