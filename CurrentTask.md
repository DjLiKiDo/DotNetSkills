# Current Task: Complete Core Handlers - Phase 1 Critical Functionality

**Task Selected:** Implement CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Risk: HIGH)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** Part of 3-day handler completion task
**Business Impact:** Core functionality non-functional

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 1, we need to complete 5 critical handlers that are throwing NotImplementedException. Completed ArchiveProjectCommandHandler and now moving to CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler.

## Task Details
- **File:** CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler.cs  
- **Issue:** Missing task creation in projects logic
- **Expected Behavior:** Should create a task within a project context with validation and assignment support
- **Dependencies:** Task domain logic, repository pattern, unit of work, mapping

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED Task planning and context documentation
- ✅ COMPLETED Located CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler file at `src/DotNetSkills.Application/ProjectManagement/Features/CreateTaskInProject/CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler.cs`
- ✅ COMPLETED Analyzed domain models and repository patterns
- ✅ COMPLETED Implemented task creation logic using DomainTask.Create() domain factory method
- ✅ COMPLETED Added comprehensive validation (project existence, user existence, parent task validation, assigned user validation)
- ✅ COMPLETED Added optional assignment logic
- ✅ COMPLETED Testing implementation (all tests pass - 169 total tests)
- ✅ COMPLETED Task successfully finished

## Implementation Details
- **Solution**: Used DomainTask.Create() factory method for task creation
- **Dependencies Injected**: ITaskRepository, IUserRepository, IProjectRepository, IUnitOfWork, IMapper, ILogger
- **Validation**: Project existence, creator existence, parent task validation, assigned user validation
- **Domain Logic**: DomainTask.Create() handles business rules and domain events
- **Assignment Logic**: Optional task assignment using task.AssignTo() domain method
- **Response Mapping**: AutoMapper with context for AssignedUserName
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (169 total tests)

## Next Task
Ready to move to next critical handler: UpdateTaskInProjectCommandHandler

## Notes
This implementation follows the same pattern as CreateTaskCommandHandler but within a project-specific context. The handler ensures that parent tasks belong to the same project and handles optional assignment during creation. Part of the broader effort to complete Phase 1 critical functionality as outlined in the technical debt analysis.

## Completed Handlers So Far
1. ✅ ArchiveProjectCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
2. ✅ CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
