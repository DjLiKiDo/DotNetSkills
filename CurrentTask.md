# Current Task: AutoMapper Configuration - Phase 1 Critical Functionality

**Task Selected:** Configure AutoMapper profiles for all application handlers  
**Priority:** HIGH (Risk: HIGH - Runtime mapping failures)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Business Impact:** 30+ handlers expecting IMapper injection will fail at runtime

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 1, AutoMapper configuration was the next critical task after completing the core handler implementations. This ensures all application handlers can successfully inject and use IMapper without runtime failures.

## Task Details
- **Issue:** AutoMapper was registered in DependencyInjection but profiles needed validation
- **Expected Behavior:** All mapping profiles should be properly configured and validated
- **Dependencies:** All bounded context mapping profiles, shared value object mappings

## Progress
- âœ… COMPLETED Task planning and context documentation
- âœ… COMPLETED Reviewed existing AutoMapper configuration in DependencyInjection.cs
- âœ… COMPLETED Validated all mapping profiles exist (UserMappingProfile, TeamMappingProfile, ProjectMappingProfile, TaskMappingProfile)
- âœ… COMPLETED Verified SharedValueObjectMappingProfile exists and is properly configured
- âœ… COMPLETED Enhanced AutoMapperConfigurationTests with comprehensive validation
- âœ… COMPLETED Added integration test for AutoMapper with dependency injection
- âœ… COMPLETED All 7 AutoMapper validation tests pass
- âœ… COMPLETED Full test suite runs successfully (171 total tests passing)

## Implementation Details
- **Mapping Profiles**: All 5 mapping profiles properly configured
  - SharedValueObjectMappingProfile: Common value objects and strongly-typed IDs
  - UserMappingProfile: User management domain mappings
  - TeamMappingProfile: Team collaboration domain mappings  
  - ProjectMappingProfile: Project management domain mappings
  - TaskMappingProfile: Task execution domain mappings
- **Validation Tests**: Enhanced test coverage from 5 to 7 tests
  - Added SharedValueObjectMappingProfile validation test
  - Added dependency injection integration test
  - All profiles validate successfully with AssertConfigurationIsValid()
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (171 total tests - 72 Domain + 26 Application + 25 Infrastructure + 48 API)

## Phase 1 Critical Functionality: COMPLETED! ðŸŽ‰
AutoMapper Configuration task successfully completed Phase 1.

## Notes
This task validates and ensures all AutoMapper profiles are properly configured and working correctly. All 30+ handlers expecting IMapper injection can now successfully use AutoMapper for entity â†” DTO transformations without runtime failures.

## Completed Phase 1 Tasks (6 of 6):
1. âœ… ArchiveProjectCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
2. âœ… CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
3. âœ… UpdateTaskInProjectCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
4. âœ… DeleteUserCommandHandler (August 11, 2025)
5. âœ… Wire MediatR to API endpoints (August 11, 2025)
6. âœ… AutoMapper Configuration (August 11, 2025)

**READY FOR PHASE 2: SECURITY HARDENING** ðŸ”’
