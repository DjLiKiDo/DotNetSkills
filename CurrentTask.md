# Current Task: Complete Core Handlers - Phase 1 Critical Functionality

**Task Selected:** Implement ArchiveProjectCommandHandler
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Risk: HIGH)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** Part of 3-day handler completion task
**Business Impact:** Core functionality non-functional

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 1, we need to complete 5 critical handlers that are throwing NotImplementedException. Starting with ArchiveProjectCommandHandler as the first priority.

## Task Details
- **File:** ArchiveProjectCommandHandler.cs  
- **Issue:** Missing project archiving logic
- **Expected Behavior:** Should archive a project (set status to archived, preserve data, handle business rules)
- **Dependencies:** Project domain logic, repository pattern, unit of work

## Progress
- COMPLETED Task planning and context documentation
- COMPLETED Located ArchiveProjectCommandHandler file at `src/DotNetSkills.Application/ProjectManagement/Features/ArchiveProject/ArchiveProjectCommandHandler.cs`
- COMPLETED Implemented archiving logic using Project.Cancel() domain method
- COMPLETED Added validation and error handling
- COMPLETED Testing implementation (all tests pass)
- COMPLETED Task successfully finished

## Implementation Details
- **Solution**: Used existing Project.Cancel() method as archive mechanism (soft delete)
- **Dependencies Injected**: IProjectRepository, IUserRepository, ICurrentUserService, IUnitOfWork
- **Validation**: Authentication check, user existence, project existence
- **Domain Logic**: Project.Cancel(user) handles business rules and domain events
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (169 total tests)

## Next Task
Ready to move to next critical handler: CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler

## Notes
This is part of the broader effort to complete Phase 1 critical functionality as outlined in the technical debt analysis. The archiving functionality interprets "archive" as project cancellation since there's no separate Archived status in the ProjectStatus enum, and cancellation effectively removes the project from active use while preserving data.
