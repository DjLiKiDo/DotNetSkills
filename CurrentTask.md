# Current Task: Complete Core Handlers - Phase 1 Critical Functionality

**Task Selected:** Implement DeleteUserCommandHandler
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Risk: HIGH)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** Part of 3-day handler completion task
**Business Impact:** Core functionality non-functional

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 1, we need to complete 5 critical handlers that are throwing NotImplementedException. Completed ArchiveProjectCommandHandler, CreateTaskInProjectCommandHandler, and UpdateTaskInProjectCommandHandler, now implementing DeleteUserCommandHandler.

## Task Details
- **File:** DeleteUserCommandHandler.cs  
- **Issue:** Missing user deletion implementation
- **Expected Behavior:** Should delete (soft delete/deactivate) a user account with proper authorization and validation
- **Dependencies:** User domain logic, repository pattern, unit of work, mapping, authentication context

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED Task planning and context documentation
- ✅ COMPLETED Located DeleteUserCommandHandler file at `src/DotNetSkills.Application/UserManagement/Features/DeleteUser/DeleteUserCommandHandler.cs`
- ✅ COMPLETED Analyzed DeleteUserCommand and existing DeactivateUserCommandHandler pattern
- ✅ COMPLETED Understood that "delete" means soft delete (deactivation) not permanent deletion
- ✅ COMPLETED Implemented user deletion logic using domain Deactivate() method
- ✅ COMPLETED Added comprehensive authorization (admin-only, current user context, self-deletion prevention)
- ✅ COMPLETED Added proper validation and idempotent behavior
- ✅ COMPLETED Testing implementation (all tests pass - 169 total tests)
- ✅ COMPLETED Task successfully finished

## Implementation Details
- **Solution**: Used user.Deactivate() domain method for soft deletion (sets status to UserStatus.Inactive)
- **Dependencies Injected**: IUserRepository, ICurrentUserService, IUnitOfWork, IMapper, ILogger
- **Authorization**: Admin-only operation, current user authentication required, prevents self-deletion
- **Validation**: User existence validation for both target and current user
- **Domain Logic**: user.Deactivate() handles business rules and preserves data integrity
- **Idempotent Behavior**: Returns success if user is already deactivated
- **Response Mapping**: AutoMapper for UserResponse DTO
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (169 total tests)

## Next Task
Ready to move to final critical handler: Wire MediatR to API endpoints

## Notes
This implementation follows the soft delete pattern typical in user management systems. Rather than permanent deletion, it deactivates the user account to preserve data integrity and audit trails. The handler enforces proper authorization (admin-only) and prevents users from deleting themselves. The operation is idempotent, returning success if the user is already deactivated.
