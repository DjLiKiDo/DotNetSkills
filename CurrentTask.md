# Current Task: Production Security - Phase 2 Security Hardening

**Task Selected:** Complete Key Vault integration, implement proper certificate validation, add secrets rotation mechanism  
**Priority:** HIGH (Risk: MEDIUM - Enhanced production security needed)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Business Impact:** Production deployment security hardening, enterprise-ready credential management

## Task Context
From CurrentPlan.md Phase 2, this task focused on hardening the security infrastructure for enterprise production deployment. Enhanced Key Vault integration, implemented automated secrets rotation, and completed authorization policy framework.

## Task Details
- **Issue:** Need enterprise-grade security with automated secrets rotation and hardened production policies
- **Expected Behavior:** Complete production security hardening with automated secret management
- **Dependencies:** Enhanced Key Vault integration, secrets rotation service, advanced authorization policies

## Progress
- âœ… COMPLETED Task planning and security analysis
- âœ… COMPLETED Removed all remaining hardcoded credentials (staging environment)
- âœ… COMPLETED Enhanced certificate validation requirements
- âœ… COMPLETED Implemented SecretsRotationService with JWT key automation
- âœ… COMPLETED Created SecretsRotationBackgroundService for automatic rotation
- âœ… COMPLETED Added comprehensive claims population service
- âœ… COMPLETED Verified all authorization policies work correctly
- âœ… COMPLETED Application startup test with all security services
- âœ… COMPLETED Full test suite runs successfully (171 total tests passing)

## Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Key Vault Integration**:
  - Secrets rotation service with cryptographically secure key generation
  - Background service for automatic JWT key rotation (90-day cycle)
  - Production, staging, and development environment security alignment
- **Certificate Validation**:
  - Removed TrustServerCertificate=true from all environments
  - Enforced proper certificate validation in production
  - Updated staging configuration to match production security standards
- **Automated Secrets Rotation**:
  - SecretsRotationService with configurable intervals
  - JWT signing key rotation with 256-bit cryptographic keys
  - Metadata tracking for rotation history and next due dates
  - Background service with configurable rotation windows
- **Advanced Authorization**:
  - ClaimsPopulationService for dynamic permission assignment
  - Team and project membership claim injection
  - Role-based and resource-based authorization support
  - Permission hierarchy (Admin > ProjectManager > Developer > Viewer)
- **Security Configuration**:
  - SecretsRotation configuration section added
  - AutomaticRotationEnabled flag for production environments
  - Configurable rotation time windows (default: 2:00 AM UTC)
- **Build Status**: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Test Status**: All tests pass (171 total tests - 72 Domain + 26 Application + 25 Infrastructure + 48 API)
- **Security Services**: SecretsRotationBackgroundService initialized correctly

## Phase 2 Security Hardening: COMPLETED! ðŸ”’
Production Security task successfully completed Phase 2.

## Notes
This task implements enterprise-grade security hardening including automated secrets rotation, advanced authorization policies, and comprehensive claims management. The solution now features automatic JWT key rotation, enhanced certificate validation, and production-ready security infrastructure suitable for enterprise deployment.

## Completed Phase 2 Tasks (2 of 2):
1. âœ… Production Security (August 11, 2025) - Enhanced Key Vault, secrets rotation, certificate validation
2. âœ… Authorization Enhancement (August 11, 2025) - Claims population service, policy validation

**PHASE 2 COMPLETE - READY FOR PHASE 3: QUALITY AND TESTING** âœ…
