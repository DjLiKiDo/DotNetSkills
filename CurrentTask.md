# Domain Layer Full Test Suite Implementation Plan

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a full test suite for the DotNetSkills domain layer. The plan covers all four bounded contexts (UserManagement, TeamCollaboration, ProjectManagement, TaskExecution) with their entities, value objects, domain events, enums, and business rules.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-007**: Use FluentAssertions for expressive test assertions
- **REQ-008**: Achieve minimum 95% code coverage for domain layer
- **REQ-009**: Tests must be fast (under 100ms each) and isolated
- **REQ-010**: Mock external dependencies appropriately

- **SEC-001**: Test authorization rules and permission checks

- **ALT-004**: Use single large test classes - Rejected in favor of focused, single-responsibility test classes
- **ALT-005**: Use reflection-based testing - Rejected to maintain explicit test scenarios and readability
