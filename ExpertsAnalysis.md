## Detailed Analysis Results

### 1. Critical Software Analysis

#### Code Quality Assessment ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Architectural Strengths:**
- **Clean Architecture Adherence**: Perfect layer separation with proper dependency direction (API ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Domain ‚Üê Infrastructure)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Excellent use of strongly-typed IDs, rich domain entities, and value objects
- **CQRS Implementation**: Proper command/query separation using MediatR
- **Consistent Conventions**: Following C# and Clean Architecture standards throughout

**File References:**
- Clean dependency structure: `src/DotNetSkills.Domain/Common/IStronglyTypedId.cs`
- Rich domain modeling: `src/DotNetSkills.Domain/UserManagement/Entities/User.cs`
- CQRS patterns: `src/DotNetSkills.Application/UserManagement/Commands/`

#### Security Audit üîí

**Implemented Security Measures:**
- JWT authentication with proper configuration
- Role-based authorization policies
- FluentValidation for input sanitization
- Strongly-typed domain validation

**Critical Security Issue - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
```json
// File: src/DotNetSkills.API/appsettings.json
{
  "Jwt": {
    "SecretKey": "your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-enough" // ‚ö†Ô∏è HARDCODED SECRET
  }
}
```

**Required Fix:**
```bash
# Move to environment variables immediately
export JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key-min-32-chars"
```
